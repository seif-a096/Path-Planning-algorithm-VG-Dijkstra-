# nodes.csv file
# All lines beginning with a # are treated as a comment and ignored.
# Adjust your input handler to skip these lines for BONUS or just remove them (no BONUS).
# Each line below has the form
# ID,x,y
# where ID is the unique integer ID number of the node (1 through N),
# (x,y) is the location of the node in the plane
# The first two nodes are your start and goal nodes repectively.
# Through C++ add your path nodes (in any order, since connections/path are defined in the edges.csv and path.csv file) to the end of this file using the same format.
# Make sure to remove any empty lines after the last node.
# Since this file only appends, make sure to clean it every run.
